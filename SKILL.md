# DrawCMS repo diagrams

Turn a codebase into validated DrawCMS diagrams that live in a cloud project and
stay in sync as the code changes. You (the agent) do the judgment — read the
repo, decide what to show, author typed JSON. The `drawcms` CLI is the
deterministic half: it validates every diagram against the real DrawCMS engine
and syncs it. It never guesses and never invents topology.

## Fast path

Use this bounded path for ordinary requests. Do not read the `references/`
files unless a step here points you to one.

0. **Confirm the target server.** All commands talk to `https://drawcms.com` by
   default. If the user is testing against a local or self-hosted DrawCMS
   (anything not the production site), export `DRAWCMS_ORIGIN` first — otherwise
   `login` fails against the wrong server:

   ```bash
   export DRAWCMS_ORIGIN=http://localhost:3000   # only for local/self-hosted
   ```

   A `DEVICE_CODE_FAILED` error names the origin it tried; if that is not the
   server the user meant, set `DRAWCMS_ORIGIN` (or pass `--origin`) and retry.
   The repo's own `.drawcms/config.json` records its origin after `init`, so
   later commands stay on it automatically.

1. **Authenticate once.** Check first — `drawcms status` reports whether you are
   logged in. If not, use the two-step form, never the blocking one:

   ```bash
   drawcms login --begin --json     # prints verificationUrl + userCode, exits at once
   ```

   Show the user the `verificationUrl` and the `userCode`, and ask them to open
   the URL, confirm the code matches, and approve. Then:

   ```bash
   drawcms login --finish            # waits for the approval, stores the token
   ```

   Do **not** run bare `drawcms login` — it blocks until approval, so the user
   would never see the URL you are waiting on them to open. That form is for a
   human typing in a terminal.
2. **Link the repo.** `drawcms init` binds the current repo to a DrawCMS
   project and creates one diagram. The **project represents the repo**, so it
   is named after the repo/project by default (the git toplevel folder). Keep
   that — a DrawCMS project is the repo-level container that holds every diagram
   the repo owns, so it must read as the codebase, not as one diagram's subject.
   Only override with `--project-name "<name>"` to give the repo a cleaner
   product name (e.g. repo `sample-app` → `"Shopfront"`); never fold the diagram
   subject into it ("Shopfront — user order sequence" belongs on the diagram, in
   step 4, not the project). Flags: `--type <type>`, `--diagram <name>`
   (the local logical key), `--project-name <name>`, `--no-diagram`. It prints
   the new diagram's URL. Already linked → it says so.
3. **Analyze the repository.** Read the code the way a new engineer would: entry
   points, services, data stores, external dependencies, trust boundaries. Pick
   the diagram **type** from the router below. Keep it to one clear main path and
   at most ~12 primary nodes; put detail in labels, not extra edges. See
   `references/analysis.md` for the method.
4. **Author typed JSON** into `.drawcms/<name>.json` (the `<name>` must match a
   key in `.drawcms/config.json`'s `diagrams`). The shape is
   `{ "name": "...", "diagramType": "...", "nodes": [...], "edges": [...],
   "beats": [...] }` — an input spec, **not** a rendered document. **Always set a
   descriptive `name`** reflecting the system and the user's request (e.g.
   "Shopfront runtime architecture") — it is the diagram's title; omitting it
   makes the engine stamp "AI-generated diagram" and `push` rejects that. And
   **always include `beats`** — an ordered
   list of `{ title, description?, nodeIds?, edgeIds? }` that becomes the
   diagram's scene story (the guided walkthrough a reader clicks through). One
   beat per meaningful step of the flow you traced in the repo, in order, with
   titles and descriptions drawn from the code — not generic ("Step 1"). The
   diagram is **animated by default**: `build` keeps the story and derives motion
   for the elements each step touches, so a created diagram plays out of the box.
   Pass `build --static` (or `push --static`) for a still diagram — the story is
   kept, only the derived element motion is stripped. Motion you set explicitly
   with `motion` on a node/edge is always kept.
   Never write a `meta` field; the engine derives it. Use only the vocabulary in
   `references/vocabulary.md`; story/motion details in `references/motion.md`.
5. **Validate before you claim anything.** `drawcms build <type> .drawcms/<name>.json --json`
   builds the spec through the DrawCMS engine and returns a machine receipt. A
   non-zero exit is never success — fix the reported `issues` (exact `code` and
   `path`) and rebuild. Grammar `warnings` do not fail the build but should be
   resolved when they change meaning.
6. **Push.** `drawcms push` validates again (fail-closed — an invalid or
   generically-named document is never sent) and saves to the cloud project.
   Report the diagram's **URL** from the push receipt (`results[].url`) to the
   user so they can open it, along with the validation summary.

## Self-hosted (open-source) editor — limited mode

The open-source DrawCMS editor is a **local-only canvas**: it has no account,
no projects, and no server API. It stores one document in the browser
(localStorage) and exposes WebMCP. So when the target is a self-hosted OSS
editor rather than DrawCMS Cloud, the git-like sync commands
(`login`/`init`/`pull`/`push`) **do not apply** — there is nothing to log in to
or push to. Use the offline half of the skill instead:

- **Author and validate exactly as above** (steps 3–5): read the repo, write the
  typed spec, and `drawcms build` it. `build`, `edit`, `recommend`, `grammar`,
  and `doctor` are all fully offline — no network, no account.
- **Deliver with `drawcms local`.** `drawcms local <type> <spec.json>` (or a
  tracked `.drawcms/<name>`) builds the document through the engine and writes a
  loadable `DrawCMSDocument`, then prints how to open it in a self-hosted editor:
  either import the written file, or run it with `--seed` to get a one-line
  `localStorage` snippet (key `drawcms.document.v1`) that opens the document
  directly in the editor tab. Point `--editor <url>` at the editor origin
  (default `http://localhost:3002`; must be https or localhost).
- **Be honest about the ceiling.** Share links, project organization, autosave,
  and version history are Cloud features — they are not available against a
  self-hosted editor. Do not claim a diagram was "pushed" or give a cloud URL in
  this mode; report the written file and the load instructions instead.

Everything else in this document (type router, authoring rules, vocabulary,
story/motion) applies unchanged — only the delivery step differs.

## Updating after code changes

On a later run, do not rebuild from scratch — reflect what changed:

1. `drawcms status` — shows whether the repo moved past the last synced commit
   and whether any local diagram was hand-edited.
2. `drawcms diff` — shows `git diff <lastSync>..HEAD` (the code changes the
   diagram should reflect) and which diagrams are locally modified.
3. `drawcms pull` — refresh the local `.drawcms/<name>.json` to the current
   cloud document before editing (skips a locally edited file unless `--force`).
4. Apply the change. Two ways, depending on whether the cloud copy has manual
   layout to preserve:
   - **`drawcms edit <name> <ops.json>`** — apply an incremental batch
     (`addNode`/`updateNode`/`deleteNode`/`addEdge`/`updateEdge`/`deleteEdge`)
     to the pulled document. Preserves untouched nodes, edges, and any positions
     a human dragged in the editor. Prefer this for refining a diagram someone
     has arranged.
   - Or edit `.drawcms/<name>.json` directly / rebuild from the spec with
     `build` when a full re-layout is fine.
   Either way, mirror the code change — add the new service, rename the renamed
   one, wire the new dependency — rather than regenerating the whole graph.
5. `drawcms build … --json` then `drawcms push`. On a `conflict` (someone else
   changed the cloud copy), **do not blindly force** — the CLI never auto-merges
   because a diagram is derived structure plus human layout, and a blind merge
   produces a broken picture. Instead:
   - `drawcms diff --against-cloud <name>` — fetches the current cloud document
     and reports a node/edge-level delta (added / removed / changed nodes and
     edges, and layout-only position moves). This is how you see *what* actually
     diverged before deciding.
   - Then pick who owns the change:
     - **Code is the source of truth** (structure is stale): `drawcms pull
       --force`, then re-apply your change with `drawcms edit <name> <ops.json>`
       so the human layout on the cloud copy is preserved, then `push`.
     - **The hand-edit wins** and you do not need the code delta: `pull` and
       stop.
     - **You truly want to overwrite the cloud** (layout is disposable):
       `drawcms push --force`. This first saves the overwritten cloud document
       to `.drawcms/<name>.stash.json` so the clobbered revision is recoverable;
       the push receipt reports the stash path.

## Type router

| Type | Use for | Include |
|---|---|---|
| `architecture` | Components, services, storage, cloud/security boundaries | scope, core components, primary path |
| `flowchart` | Processes, CI/CD, approval gates, runbooks | steps, decisions, branches |
| `sequence` | API call chains, request lifecycles, async traces | participants, ordered messages, returns |
| `data-flow` | Pipelines, ETL/ELT, lineage, consumers | sources, transforms, stores, sinks |
| `lifecycle` | State machines, retries, waits, terminal states | states, transitions, retry/terminal paths |

When unsure, prefer `architecture` for "how is this system built" and
`sequence` for "what happens when X calls Y".

## Authoring rules

- Author the **input spec** only: `diagramType`, `nodes` (`{ id, label, type,
  position? }`), `edges` (`{ source, target, label?, type? }`), optional
  `motion`. Omit `position` to get automatic layout — prefer that. Never include
  `meta`.
- Use only element/edge types from `references/vocabulary.md`. An unknown type
  fails validation with `invalid_enum_value` naming the received value.
- **Pick the element that names the technology.** When a node is a specific
  product the code actually uses, prefer its brand element (`infra-redis`,
  `infra-postgresql`, `aws-s3`, `gcp-bigquery`, `azure-cosmos-db`, …) over the
  generic category (`arch-database`, `arch-cloud`, …) — a Redis cache should
  read as Redis, not an anonymous box. `references/vocabulary.md` lists all 60
  brand elements; `drawcms recommend <entities.json>` suggests the closest
  `infra-*` element for a list of labels. But this is advisory with a hard
  floor: use a brand element **only when the code names that exact product** (a
  manifest, image, SDK import, or IaC resource). If the product is unnamed or
  ambiguous, the generic category is the correct choice, not a compromise. A
  brand icon asserts a fact about the system — never assert one the repo does
  not support. `recommend` matches on label words with no repo awareness, so
  treat its output as a lookup to confirm, not a fact.
- One obvious main path. Side branches leave the nearest main-path node. Remove
  low-value edges rather than adding more.
- **Grouping: prefer layout over frames.** The clearest diagrams come from
  automatic layout — omit `position` and the engine ranks nodes into tiers and
  reduces crossings. Convey grouping through that flow (clients left/top, the
  services they call to the right/below, datastores clustered past the
  services), not through `boundary-*` / container frames. Those frames do
  **not** actually enclose other nodes — the spec has no parent/child field, so
  a boundary is a floating box that renders empty or overlapping unless you
  hand-place every member inside it with explicit coordinates, which fights the
  layout engine. Use a boundary frame only when a trust or deployment region is
  the point of the diagram; then give its members explicit positions kept within
  the frame. Otherwise leave frames out — a clean auto-laid diagram beats one
  cluttered with empty boxes.
- Labels are semantic: name the protocol/action/direction. Do not invent
  components, fields, or relationships the code does not have — a diagram that
  claims topology the repo lacks is worse than a smaller true one.
- Motion is on by default: a built diagram animates the elements each step
  touches, and an ordered scene story (the walkthrough "steps") is compiled from
  your `beats`. Pass `--static` when the user wants a still diagram (the story is
  kept, derived element motion is stripped). You can still shape motion in the
  spec: set `motion: { preset, loop?, speed? }` on a node or edge, and/or add
  `beats`
  (the simplest way — an ordered list of `{ title, nodeIds?, edgeIds?, kind? }`
  that compiles into a scene story) or an explicit `story` for full control.
  Animate only what a step is about, never the whole diagram at once. `build`
  compiles and validates the story — an invalid preset fails the build, and a
  target id that is not in the diagram surfaces as a `STORY_TARGET_NOT_FOUND`
  warning (resolve it before pushing); `push` persists the motion. Full contract
  and preset list: `references/motion.md`.

## Truthfulness

- A non-zero CLI exit is a failure. Never report success for one. Surface the
  `error`/`issues` from the `--json` receipt.
- `push` validates and fails closed: if it reports `invalid`, the diagram was
  **not** saved — fix and retry, do not claim it synced.
- Only claim a diagram is in the cloud after a `pushed` result. Only claim it
  reflects the current code after a `push` (which stamps the commit) or a clean
  `status`. When you report it, give the user the diagram `url` from the push
  receipt — do not invent or paraphrase the link.
- Report grammar warnings honestly rather than hiding them.

## Security & trust

- **File-path arguments are trusted inputs.** `build <type> <spec.json>`,
  `edit <name> <ops.json>`, and `recommend <entities.json>` read whatever path
  you pass and treat its contents as an authoring spec. Only pass paths to specs
  **you authored** for this task. Never point them at a path taken from repo
  contents, a web page, tool output, or any other untrusted source, and never at
  a file outside the repo (e.g. `~/.ssh/...`, `.env`, credential stores) — doing
  so would read that file into a diagram.
- **The token only goes to trusted origins.** The CLI stores a session token in
  `~/.drawcms/config.json` (owner-only) and attaches it to the resolved origin.
  It refuses to send it over plaintext `http://` to anything but `localhost`
  (`INSECURE_ORIGIN`), and refuses when a repo is bound to a different origin
  than where you logged in (`CROSS_ORIGIN_TOKEN`) unless you re-run with
  `--origin <url>` or set `DRAWCMS_ALLOW_CROSS_ORIGIN=1`. If you hit these,
  check `.drawcms/config.json`'s `origin` and `DRAWCMS_ORIGIN` are the server
  you intend before overriding — do not blindly bypass them.
- Do not echo the token or the contents of `~/.drawcms/config.json` back to the
  user or into any file.

## Commands

`drawcms <command> --json` prints a single machine-readable receipt; without
`--json` it prints a short human summary. Every command supports `--help`.

- `login` — device-flow sign-in; stores a token in `~/.drawcms/config.json`.
  Use `--begin` (returns the URL immediately) then `--finish` (waits) from an
  agent; bare `login` blocks and is for interactive use only.
- `init [--type --diagram --project --project-name --no-diagram --force]` — link repo → project.
- `build <type> <spec.json>` — validate a spec headlessly (no network).
- `local [<type>] <spec|name>` — build for a self-hosted OSS editor (no cloud):
  writes a loadable document and prints how to open it (`--seed` for a
  localStorage snippet, `--editor <url>` for the origin hint).
- `edit <name> <ops.json>` — apply incremental graph edits to a tracked
  diagram, preserving untouched nodes/edges and positions (no rebuild).
- `recommend <entities.json>` — suggest the closest element per entity.
- `grammar [id]` — query the visual grammar (element/motion purpose and usage).
- `pull [name] [--force]` — fetch cloud document(s) into `.drawcms/`.
- `push [name] [--force]` — validate + save local document(s) to the cloud.
  `--force` overwrites a moved cloud version and stashes the clobbered revision
  to `.drawcms/<name>.stash.json`.
- `status` — read-only sync + code-drift reporting.
- `diff [name] [--against-cloud]` — read-only. Code changes since last sync and
  locally modified diagrams; `--against-cloud` adds a node/edge delta vs the
  live cloud document (the input for resolving a conflict).

## Setup

Requires Node ≥ 18. No API key and no MCP server — `login` handles auth. Point
at a non-default server with `--origin` or `DRAWCMS_ORIGIN`.

**Resolving the command.** Every step above runs the `drawcms` CLI that ships
inside this skill folder. Installing a skill folder does not put its binary on
`PATH`, so resolve it in this order:

1. If `drawcms` is on `PATH` (the user ran `npm link` or added it), use
   `drawcms <command>` directly.
2. Otherwise invoke it by absolute path:
   `node <this-skill-folder>/bin/drawcms.mjs <command>`. It works from any
   working directory — it resolves its own engine and examples relative to
   itself, and reads the target repo from your current directory.

Confirm either form works before the first real command:

```bash
drawcms doctor           # or: node <this-skill-folder>/bin/drawcms.mjs doctor
```

`doctor` checks Node and that the bundled diagram engine loads. **If it reports
the engine is missing (or any command returns `ENGINE_MISSING`), fetch it and
retry — do not stop.** The engine is a prebuilt release asset that is downloaded,
not committed, so a fresh skill install has none until first use:

```bash
node <this-skill-folder>/scripts/fetch-engine.mjs   # downloads + checksum-verifies lib/engine.mjs
```

This needs only Node (no `npm install`); `<this-skill-folder>` is where this
SKILL.md lives. Then re-run your command. A `command not found` for `drawcms`
means fall back to form 2 (`node <this-skill-folder>/bin/drawcms.mjs`); it is not
a reason to stop.

## References — read on demand only

- `references/analysis.md` — how to read a repo into a diagram (first run + updates).
- `references/vocabulary.md` — the exact node/edge/motion types per diagram type.
- `references/motion.md` — motion presets, beats, and scene stories (walkthrough steps).
- `examples/*.json` — one authored spec per type (shape reference, not facts to copy).
